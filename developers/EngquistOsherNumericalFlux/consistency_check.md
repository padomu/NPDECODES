- Solution of part (g): Equation numbers (8.2.5) and (8.2.6) should not be blue
- Solution of part (g): Missing an equal sign: f'(u) = sinh(u)
- Solution of part (g): Should be Engquist-Osher flux and not Godunov
- Part (h): Typo: Remove unecessary 'up' just before _explicit Euler_
- Part (h): `u0` is a column vector, not a row vector
- Part (h): There is no vector `ufinal`. `u0` is returned
- Part (h): Add [ depends on Sub-problem (8-2.g) ]
- Part (i): Missing time hint
